    <h2>What is HTML? </h2>
     
     <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
         It can be assisted bytechnologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <h3><li>Hypertext:</li></h3> text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
       <h3><li>Markup:</li></h3> a style guide for type setting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
       <h3><li>Language:</li></h3> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
    </p>
    <h2>What is XTML? </h2>
    <P>
      Extensible HyperText Markup Language is part of the family of XML markup languages. 
      It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language,<br> 
      the language in which Web pages are formulated.<br>

        <h2>What are the new form elements in HTML5?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML5 introduces a number of new form elements. Some of them are <'datalist'>
            <'output'>, <'progress'>,<'keygen'> and <'meter'>. <br>
            In addition to this,
            there are different input types which we can use
            with the <'input'> element.
        </p>
         <br>
         <h2>What is DOM? </h2>
         <p>The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard</p>
      
         <p>
             DOM (Document object model) is platform and language natural interface taht allows 
             programs and <br>
             scripts
              to dynamically access and update the content structure, and style of a Document     
         </p>
          <h3>The DOM is separeted into 3 different parts / level</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><h3>Core-DOM</h3><p>standerd model for any structured document</p></li>
            <li><h3>XML-DOM</h3><P>standerd model for XML document</P> </li>
            <li><h3>HTML-DOM</h3><p>standerd model for HTML document </p></li>
         </ul>
        <h2>What does a <'DOCTYPE html'> do?</h2>

        <p>
            Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration. It informs the web browser about 
            the type and version of HTML used in building the web document.<br> This helps the browser
             to handle and load it properly.
        </p>

         <h2>what is the building blocks in html5</h2>
         <p>
            Building blocks of HTML
            An HTML document consist of its basic building blocks which are: Tags: An HTML tag surrounds the content and apply meaning to it.<br>
             It is written between < and > brackets. Attribute: An attribute in HTML provides extra information about the element,<br>
             and it is applied within the start tag.,<br>  
         </p>

        <h2>What are the building blocks of HTML5?</h2>
        <p>
           <ul>
            <li><h3>Semantics</h3> — Allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.</li>
            <li><h3>Connectivity </h3> — Allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.</li>
            <li><h3>Offline and storage</h3> — Allowing webpages to store data on the client-side <br>
                locally and operate offline more efficiently.</li>
            <li><h3>Multimedia</h3> — Making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.</li>
            <li><h3>2D/3D graphics and effects </h3>  — Allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.</li>
            <li><h3>Performance and integration </h3>  — Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.</li>
            <li><h3>Device access  </h3>  — Allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.</li>
            <li><h3>Styling </h3>— Letting authors write more sophisticated themes.</li>
           </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>What is the difference between a < span > and a < div >?</h2>
        <h3>
            Both the tags (< div > and < span >) are used to represent the part of the webpgage,
          < div > tag is used a as block<br>
           part of the webpage and < span > tag is used as a inline part of the webpage like below:
        </h3>
       
        <h2>Name 5 common block-level and inline HTML elements?</h2>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What are semantic and non-semantic elements?</h2>

        <h3>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</h3>

        <h3>Semantic Elements in HTML</h3>
        <p>Many web sites contain HTML code like: < div id="nav" > < div class="header" > 
        < div id="footer" > to indicate navigation, header, and footer.</p>

        <h3>In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:</h3>
         
        <ul>
        <li>< article ></li>
        <li>< section ></li>
        <li>< main ></li>
        <li>< footer ></li>
        <li>< nav ></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Non-Semantic elements</h3>  
        <p>
            Unlike, semantic elements they don’t have any meaning. 
            They don’t tell anything about the content they contain.<br>
            They can be used with different attributes to mark up semantics common to a group.
        </p> 
        <h2>Why you would like to use semantic tag?</h2>
        <p>
           HTML5's semantic elements help structure the code we create, making it more readable and easier to maintain.
            They help us think about the structure of our dynamic data,<br> and to choose titles' hierarchy properly.
           They help us differentiate the semantic elements of our markup from the ones we use solely for layout
        </p>
        <h2>What are the semantic tags available in html5?</h2>

        <h3>The semantic elements added in HTML5 are:</h3>
        <p>
            < article >
                < aside >
                < details >
                < figcaption >
                < figure >
                < footer >
                < header ><br>
                <  main>
                < mark >
                < nav >
                < section >
                < summary >
                < time >
        </p>
      
        <h2>What is an optional tag?</h2>

        <p>
         Basically, that's the idea of optional HTML tags: you don't have to write an HTML tag 
         if you can easily infer it from the context. For instance,<br> there's no point in writing the < html > tag.
         The document is shown in the browser, so we already know it's an HTML document.
        </p>

        <h2>What are optional closing tag?</h2>

        <p>
            The tags are optional because it's implied that a new tag would not be able to be started without closing it.
            These are the following: html, head, body,<br> p, dt, dd, li, option, thead, th, tbody, tr, td, tfoot, colgroup .
            There are also tags that are forbidden to be closed: img, input, br, hr, meta, etc
       </p>   

       <h2>What is a self closing tag?</h2>

       <p>

        A self-closing tag is an element of HTML code that has evolved in the language. Typically, 
        the self-closing tag makes use of a “/” 
        character in order to effectively close out a beginning tag enclosed in sideways carets.
       </p>

       <h2>What is the purpose of main element?</h2>
       <p>
        The main element represents the main content section of the body of a document or application.
        The main content section consists of content that is directly<br>
         related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application.  
       </p>
       <h2>When should you use section, div or article?</h2>
       <p>
        So which should you use and when? If the content within the element is not semantically related, then use a < div > . <br>
        If the semantically related content is also able to be self-contained, then use an < article > . Otherwise, use a < section > 

       </p>

       <h2>How to make page responsive?</h2>
       <p>
        <ol start="1">
               <li>Add responsive meta tags in your HTML document</li>
               <li>Apply media queries to your layout.</li>
               <li>Make images and embedded videos responsive.</li>
               <li>Ensure your typography will be easily readable on mobile devices.</li>
        </ol>
       </p>
       <h2>What is Character Encoding?</h2>
       <p>
        Character encoding tells computers how to interpret digital data into letters, numbers and symbols.
        This is done by assigning a specific numeric value to a letter, number or symbol.
       </p>

       <h2> What is the purpose of meta tags?</h2>
       <p>
        Meta tags are pieces of information you use to tell the search engines and those viewing your site more about your page and the information it contains.
         Meta tags include:<br> Title tags: the title of your page, which should be unique for every page you publish.
         Meta description: a description of the content on the page.</p>

        <h2>What is the purpose of the alt attribute on images?</h2> 

        <p>
            The < img > alt attribute is used to specify the alternate text for an image. 
            It is useful when the image not displayed. It is used to give alternative information for an image.<br>
            <b>SYNTAX :< img alt="text"></b>
        </p>
        <h2>What is difference between Select and DataList?</h2>
        <h3>Select </h3>
        <p>Select input element presents options for the users from which they need to select one of them.
            On the otherhand,</p>
        <h3>Datalist</h3>    
        <p> Datalist presents a list of suggested values to the associated input form (text) field and users are free<br> 
            to select one of those suggested values or type in their own value.</p>
        <h2>What is desktop first and mobile first design approach?</h2>
        <p>
         Desktop users usually have more time and faster internet. ... Designing for mobile first before the desktop version makes it more difficult in the long run.<br>        It's harder to expand on a simple design and content (mobile-to-desktop) than it is to simplify a desktop design (desktop-to-mobile).
        </p>

       
       <h2>What are data- attributes good for?</h2>
       
       <p>
        It’s important to recognize that an attribute is simply data that describes other data — you should not imagine it as external to the dataset. 
        In this sense, an attribute is a way we use one part of the data to describe other parts.
                                            <br><br>
        data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes,
        or extra properties on DOM.                                   
       </p>

       <h2>Explain About html canvas </h2>

       <p>The HTML < canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. The < canvas> element is only a container for graphics.
         You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.</p>

         <h2>What is difference between SVG and Canvas?</h2>

         <p>
            SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.
                                    <br>
            An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

         <h2> Explain Drag and Drop in HTML5?</h2>


         <p>
            A drag and drop website builder is a tool that allows anyone with a computer and internet connection to create a website. It doesn't require you to write code 
            <br>or learn a single command in CSS. All you have to do is select a basic layout (or theme), 
            and drag pre-set elements to where you want them on each page.
         </p>

         <h2>Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage?</h2>

         <p><h3>Local storage</h3>
            5MB to 10MB storage its not session based need to be deleted via JS or manually 
            Clint side reading only less older browsers support   
        </p>

        <h2> List the API available in HTML5?</h2>
    
         <p><h3>File API</h3>Provides programs with secure access to the device’s filesystem.</p>
         <p><h3>History API</h3>Allows programs to manipulate the browser history.</p>
         <p><h3>Proximity API</h3>Provides information about the distance between a device and anobject.</p>
         <p><h3>Internationalization API</h3>Provides access to locale-sensitive formatting and stringcomparison.</p>
         <p><h3>Web Audio API</h3>API for processing and synthesizing audio.etc</p>
         
         
         
         
            <h3>A. <'script></h3>

            <p>                
          Scripts offer authors a means to extend HTML documents in highly active and interactive ways.
          For example: Scripts may be evaluated as a document loads to modify the contents of the document dynamically.
          Scripts may accompany a form to process input as it is entered.
            </p>
            <h3>Async and defer </h3>
            <p>
            .Async and defer are basically two boolean attributes for the < script > tag. Async allows the execution 
            of 'scripts asynchronously as soon as they're downloaded. 'Defer allows execution only after
             the whole 'document' has been parsed. Both attributes don't have any effect on inline 'scripts'.
